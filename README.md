# Abstract-SimplifierðŸ“„ðŸ”¥
## Objective

This project's goal is to support researchers in their analysis. Each researcher must quickly scan through numerous study articles in an effort to discover the ones that are relevant to the subject at hand. In order to select the applicable papers, they must read the abstracts of each one. Yet occasionally, if the abstract lacks a sufficient framework, it becomes time-consuming. This abstract-simplifier helps in making reading easier, quicker & efficient and contribute in NLP research.

## Data 

 the authors of the paper have made the data they used for their research availably publically and for free in the form of .txt files [on GitHub](https://github.com/Franck-Dernoncourt/pubmed-rct).
